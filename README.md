🌊 Water Treatment Cost, Risk & Environmental Impact Analysis

Python • SQL • Power BI • Data Analytics

📌 Project Summary

This project analyses multiple water treatment systems by comparing operational cost, health risk (DALY), environmental footprint, and resource distribution performance.
Using Python, SQL, and Power BI, the dataset was cleaned, modelled, validated, and visualised to support evidence-based decision making for sustainable water treatment.

🎯 Objectives

Compare treatment systems based on cost, risk, and environmental impact

Evaluate carbon footprint and sustainability metrics

Build dashboards for easy interpretation of results

Validate and structure dataset using SQL

Produce analytical insights from raw treatment data

🛠 Tech Stack

Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib)

SQL (data validation & summarisation)

Power BI (interactive dashboards)

Excel / CSV datasets

📈 Key Findings

Low-cost systems can show higher DALY risk

High-energy methods contribute significantly to carbon emissions

Balanced systems perform better across cost, risk, and sustainability

Dashboards reveal which systems provide the best long-term trade-offs

Supports sustainable planning and resource decision making
